# Data for Behavioral Testing in Machine Translation

This data set accompanies the research paper, [Automating Behavioral Testing in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02553).

It includes the following:
- ``data/prompts_src_gen`` contains the prompts that were used to generate the English source sentences for behavioral testing, as described in the paper.
- ``data/filtered_src_gen `` contains the generated source sentences after the filter steps outlined in the paper.
- ``data/prompts_candidates`` contains the prompts that were used to generate the target-language-specific candidate sets.
- ``data/candidate_sets`` contains the generated candidate sets (unfiltered).
